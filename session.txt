n the general situation :

the session id is sent to the user when his session is created.
it is stored in a cookie (called, by default, PHPSESSID)
that cookie is sent by the browser to the server with each request
the server (PHP) uses that cookie, containing the session_id, to know which file corresponds to that user.
The data in the sessions files is the content of $_SESSION, serialized (ie, represented as a string -- with a function such as serialize) ; and is un-serialized when the file is loaded by PHP, to populate the $_SESSION array.


Sometimes, the session id is not stored in a cookie, but sent in URLs, too -- but that's quite rare, nowadays.
